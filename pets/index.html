		    Klaus is an outdoor cat that I take care of, but he is a free spirit and will sometimes 
			not come by the house for days at a time. I keep food and water outside for him and give
			him flea medicine. He likes to come inside to cool off, eat, and play with Oz sometimes;
			however, he is not allowed in certain rooms of the house and does not like to stay overnight
			often.
